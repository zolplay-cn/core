An adapter for the awesome original package `class-variance-authority`.

CSS-in-TS libraries such as [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/variants) and [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/) are **fantastic** options for building type-safe UI components; taking away all the worries of class names and StyleSheet composition.

`cva` aims to take those pain points away, allowing you to focus on the more fun aspects of UI development.
